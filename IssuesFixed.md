## Deploying in Sydney and Mumbai regions
Created two different stacks for two regions. For the AMIs and availability zones I have used the same yml templates and changed the values for the AMI and availability zones while I run the deployment. 

Here below the URLs for the two deployments

Sydney Region: http://ec2-13-210-71-180.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/

Mumbai Region: http://ec2-13-235-243-106.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com/
